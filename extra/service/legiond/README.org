#+title: Legiond
* Why legiond
~legiond~ daemon is made to solve the following problems:
** ~legion_cli~ being triggered multiple times in a short period
We used to use path to trigger the fancurve-set script,
which could result in reaching systemd limits.

We don't have to trigger it every time, just need to make sure it gets triggered last time.
** Unpersistent cpu tweaks
We observed that after running for a while, ~undervolt~ and ~ryzenadj~ tweaks to the cpu may not work.

To solve that, We introduce a ~systemd.timer~ to run cpu tweaks every 30s.
Because we use ~legiond-cli~, if a ~fancurve-set~ task is to start, it will refresh the timer of ~legiond~.
This avoids non-essential ~fancurve-set~ being run.
** Power state change on resume prevent ~fancurve-set~ from setting correct fancurve
Now we use a ~3s~ delay to make sure it works fine.
Every power-state/power-profile change will reset the timer.
* How it works
~legiond~ is divided into two parts, ~legiond~ and ~legiond-cli~.
~legiond~ is running as a ~systemd.service~, ~legiond-cli~ is a bridge between ~legiond-cpuset.service~ and ~legiond-resume.service~ with ~legiond.service~.

~legiond-cli~ send request to ~legiond~ via [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket][Unix domain socket]].

When the power-state or power-profile changed, ~acpid.service~ send a request to ~legiond~ via ~legiond-cli~.
~legiond~ will call ~fancurve-set~ script after a variable delay(depend on ~legiond-cli~ arguments).
* Configuration
#+begin_src shell
sudo cp /usr/share/legion_linux/{*.yaml,.env} /etc/legion_linux/
#+end_src

Edit fancurve profile ~.yaml~ to fit your needs.

Modify ~/etc/legion_linux/.env~ with your favorate editor.

Enable ~systemd.service~:
#+begin_src shell
systemctl enable --now legiond.service legiond-onresume.service legiond-cpuset.timer
#+end_src
